Responsive Navigation Bar with Dropdown Menu
This project features a fully responsive navigation bar for websites, designed to enhance user experience across devices. The navigation bar includes multiple menu items, some of which have sub-menu (dropdown) items.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The navigation bar is styled using CSS with media queries to ensure it looks great on all screen sizes. On smaller screens, the menu collapses into a hamburger menu for easy access.
Dropdown Menus: Certain categories in the navigation bar contain dropdown menus, allowing for organized and accessible navigation.
Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used to add interactivity, such as opening and closing the dropdowns and the hamburger menu when clicked.
Smooth Transitions: The UI includes smooth transitions and animations for an enhanced user experience.
Accessibility: The design is both keyboard and touch-friendly, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For creating the structure of the navigation bar.
CSS: For styling the navigation bar, adding transitions, and making the design responsive.
JavaScript: For handling the interactivity, including the opening and closing of dropdowns and the hamburger menu.
This project serves as a template for modern, responsive web navigation, suitable for a wide range of web development projects.
